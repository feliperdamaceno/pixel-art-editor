## { App: 'Pixel Art Editor' }

![page-showcase](app-showcase/app-showcase.gif)

This is a personal project I've decided to create using React to test my knowledge. It is a simple pixel art editor. This editor includes the functionality to select the color you want to use, draw the pixels, erase, delete, toggle the grid and download the image in .png if desired. There is a website to test the project below, I hope you've appreciated it.
